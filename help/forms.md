## Forms

Lightning provides basic tools for creating forms that your site's visitors can
fill out and submit. It uses the Contact module, which ships with Drupal core,
to do this. Contact is designed for creating simple contact forms, but is
actually quite flexible and can be used to build fairly complicated forms for
purposes other than just contacting you :)

It is not as robust or full-featured as the Webform module, but we feel that
it strikes a good balance between functionality and simplicity that should cover
most use cases. If you need to create dozens of different forms, or very complex
forms, you should use Webform, not Contact.

To create a form, visit *Structure* > *Contact forms* and click **Add contact
form**.
